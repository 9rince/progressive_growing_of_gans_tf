# Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation on TensorFlow

This repository contains the **TensorFlow re-implementation (both training and sampling)** of [original implementation (Theano and Lasagne)](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans). The author of this repo is actively training and debugging on 1024x1024 CelebA dataset.

## Dataset: 1024x1024 CelebA faces
